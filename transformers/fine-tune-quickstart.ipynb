I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

They staff was super attentive and I never had to ask for a water refills, but my server was very sassy in a TV sitcom sort of way. She tried to make little quirky jokes every time she came to the table, but they just came off like she was mad at the world and we were the cause of it. Like I said very TV sitcom-ish. \\n\\nThe decor here needs to be updated desperately. It has a cafeteria look; very open and very cold, but with a country grandma style. By this I mean there's random farm and rooster decor on the walls. Which makes me laugh because roosters don't lay eggs. It's Science! \\n\\nThe food is tasty, but basic. I was here with four other people and I tried everyone's dish... I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad; the salad for the guy who never orders salad. This was great in my opinion, big chunks of chicken coated in buffalo sauce on huge bed of fresh greens w/ eggs and tomatoes. My foodie friends ordered the \\\"Veggie Benny\\\", \\\"The Cobb\\\", and the \\\"Pesto Scramble\\\". \\n\\nThe \\\"Veggie Benny\\\" was the star in this line-up. This plate comes with spinach, avocado, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was creamy, but lite in an interesting way, and the hash browns were golden brown and crispy. I would most likely order this if I came back to the Cracked Egg. The other dishes were forgetful and don't need to be mentioned in this review. \\n\\nThis place needs a design overhaul and few updates on the menu. These simple changes could really elevate this place...Where's Robert Irvine?!?\\n\\nPro Tip: The baked goods in this place are steller. Try the Blueberry Muffin/Coffee Cake</td>\n",

The best way I can describe my club experience with the Bank Nightclub is a hate-love relationship.  The club itself I would say is ok but on the small side.  It's one of the smaller clubs I've been too in Las Vegas and probably holds about 700 people comfortably, but like most clubs they try to get as many people in (like this night) and people were packed in their like sardines.  We did pay for the VIP treatment, and boy did we pay.  The seats that we got was about $4K including bottle service.  No that is not a typo - $4K or a little more than $200 per person.  \\n\\nSo what does $4K get you - gets you a table that you and your buddy have to squeeze into and I believe about 6 bottles.  The person who set this up also got us a \\\"host\\\" who hooked up the whole thing.  The only thing our \\\"host\\\" did for the night, was get us front of the line pass.  Other than that, the guy was hanging out, drinking, and to add insult to injury, we also ended up paying for his buddy and he also found two ladies (not for us) but for him and his buddy to hit on while all 4 of them drank our booze.\\n\\nThe place is suppose to be upscale, but to be honest, I just didn't see.  I've been to nicer clubs and while this place charges an arm and leg, it really doesn't deliver.  The only saving grace is that some of the other guys seemed to have a goodtime.  But even then, the night was a mixed bag.  Some guys seemed to have a good time and other guys were like me and said WTF I just dropped $200 on that, and the rest were kind of like eh whatever.\\n\\nIf I had to do it all over again, honestly, I think The Bank is overhyped and under delivered.  I wouldn't go back again and would give them 2 stars.</td>\n",

When we told them our party WAS indeed all present, but just in the bathroom, they took another ten minutes to get us taken care of.  Then they scoffed when we asked where our waiter went fifteen minutes after taking our drink order.\\n\\nThe wait staff themselves are usually decent, to be honest.  But it's a little inconsistent.\\n\\nIf cheapness is your thing, come here.  After all, it's run by the wizards who brought you the authentic stylings of Chili's and On the Border (oh, sorry, most of the ladder here in Phoenix closed).  You can get a run-of-the-mill pasta and one to take home for $12.95.  I do enjoy the late night fridge raid of my second meal, but it's nothing I couldn't have spent ten minutes and made in my own pot.  The classics menu is a who's who of boring concoctions with no original take on them.\\n\\nThe atmosphere here is interesting and surprisingly void of a North Scottsdale vibe.  Problem is you never know exactly what you're going to get.  I'm not a huge fan of any chain Italian, but I'll take Carrabba's across the street; feels a bit more warm to me even if it's less hip, and the menu offers more excitement.</td>\n",

It's always busy, especially during lunch.  \\n\\nOnce you get past the mini-wait, everything starts to fall in place.  Service at this Red Lobster has always been great.  There have been times I've come here on a limited lunch break and told our server. To my surprise, they did what they can to get me and my group in &amp; out.  \\n\\nOn my most recent visit, I was craving a steak and also lobster. Then I found what I thought was perfect.  It was their Lobster Steak meal.  But if you've been here before, you know what this is. It's steak with lobster bits on top. I expected a lobster and a steak.  My bad, I should have read the menu better.  Also, the price was fair.  \\n\\nAs for their other food choices (from previous review):\\n\\n-Bottomless Shrimp:  I don't know if this is daily or all the time.  But I have had it in the past.  Their fried shrimp has more batter than shrimp, but still pretty good. \\n\\n-Seaside Shrimp Trio:  Is a favorite when in the mood for shrimp.  It's shrimp pasta, fried shrimp, and garlic shrimp\\n\\n-Tilapia and Cod  I put these all together, but their cod is really good.  Big thick pieces of flaky fish.  Tilapia is prepared pretty good to.  Both are not fishy.  \\n\\n-Steaks:  Mixed reviews here.  Had steaks here come too dry.  Had some come too juicy. Then had some just right.  Not as good as a Ruth Chris' but definitely better than a Chili's or Denny's. \\n\\n-Lobster:  My opinion, one of my favorites.  Portions small thought. \\n\\n-Stuffed Sole:  Tried once and only recently.  Did not fill me up, but still good.  Order an appetizer!!\\n\\n-Glazed Chicken:  I know it's a seafood restaurant, but have stopped by for lunch just for their chicken breast.  About 7 total oz and usually have the sauce put on the side.\\n\\n-Calamari and Fried Vegetables:  An oxymoron, but you'll find it all gone before your soup arrives.  Usually gone from me and yes, the only way I will eat vegetables. \\n\\n-Red Lobster Biscuits:  Don't remember the actual name, but this is a must on every visit.  So good and perfect to dip into you chowder. \\n\\nOverall, I recommend Red Lobster. I've never had a bad experience and you get what you pay for her. Price for seafood here is just about right for the quality you get.  Just be prepared for a little wait at this location.</td>\n",
