When I found out there was a Salvadorean restaurant nearby in Downtown Kitchener, I just had to go try it out. \\n\\nThe Guanaquita Restaurant is located up a long flight of stairs up above a watering hole near King &amp; Water. The look of the restaurant will throw first time customers off as it is noticeably Greek. Perhaps, it used to be Greek restaurant in a past life. There is a small patio facing King Street and a dance floor for various events happening at the restaurant. \\n\\nSince I lived nearby, I always called ahead for take out and never had a chance to sit down so I cannot comment on the service. It usually takes them 15-20 minutes to get your order ready.  \\n\\nOne of the most commonly ordered plates is the Guanaquita Platter - a set platter with pork and cheese pupusas, beef or chicken enchilada, chicken tamales and a beef &amp; vegetable empanada. The platter also came with a side of salsa (I always get the hot one) and coleslaw. \\n\\nAll the items in the platter were made fresh and full of flavour and reminded me of  The salsa also added the extra kick needed for me when eating Latin American food. I was not a fan of the coleslaw though. \\n\\nThe only caveat for me is that it is closed on Sundays and Mondays. \\n\\nAll in all, a great place for some Salvadorean food whether it is your first time or whether you are just satisfying a craving.</td>\n",

Places like Red Lobster are on the upper end of the scale for me.  With that said, it should come as no surprise that I avoided McCormick &amp; Schmick's for a while.  I knew it to be a high end seafood restaurant and so I shyed away.  That is until a couple of years ago when they offered a tax day specical.  I don't remember the exact price of their special menu items but it was within reason.  I went in, sat in the bar area where there was some room left.  I ordered pasta with alfredo sauce and shrimp and baby scallops.  It was very good.  I have never been a fan of scallops but these were done right.  Not at all fishy.  Not the least bit chewy.  Just sweet and numerous.  I really rather enjoyed myself.  Much to my surprise, when I left I received a coupon for a certain percentage off my next order.  I'm sorry I don't remember specifically.  It was a while ago afterall.  Any how, I did go back a few months after my April 15th initial visit.  This next time I was seated in the actual dining room.  I ordered shrimp scampi.  While I prefer the scampi at Red Lobster this was still very good.  I ate every bit and sopped up the remaining sauce with my bread.  I stuffed myself and had a pleasent experience.  The service was great.  Very friendly staff.  Good food.  A beautiful interior.  I would love to go back perhaps for some special occasion.  However, unfortunately for me, I am not really a fan of most seafood.  Mostly just crab legs and shrimp which I seem to be developing an allergy to (this is where you imagine me hanging my head in shame and self pitty).  I may still go back if I ever have company who wants a good dinner at a place other than the larger chain places.  Perhaps I would order sword fish or mahi mahi if either were on the menu.  Those are two that I will eat.  So maybe some day.</td>\n",

When I pulled into CityCenter on Saturday morning, it was pretty quiet as I drove through the still under development shopping center.  I easily found a parking spot just outside Press and headed inside.  \\n\\nI was immediately greeted by two different employees with big smiles and \\\"How are you this morning!?\\\".  Good first impression.  The space is casually upscale and feels very comfortable with couches up front, a long laptop bar along the side and a large group table in the back.  The patio outside is awesome as well and \\\"pet friendly\\\".  One of the employees told me they are planning a Doggy Dinner in a couple weeks out the patio and that they already have sold out.  Pretty unique and neighborhood friendly idea.\\n\\nI ordered a small Americano which was served right up and headed outside to sit on the patio and enjoy the sun.  Free wi-fi is provided (90 minutes with a code provided at purchase) and I enjoyed surfing around while soaking up the beautiful morning.  The place was lively the entire time I was there with families, couples, and a few dogs out of the patio.  Good vibe.\\n\\nI decided to try out the Chai that I had read about in Marc's review and it was really great.  I also ordered the Club Panini which was served with some chips and a sweet pickle.  Great sandwich.  Simple, clean, perfect Saturday afternoon Bistro food.\\n\\nI didn't sample any of the wine but I did talk to the owner Steve for a while about the evenings and it sounds like they have a real passion for wine and the wine bar experience.  If it is as good as the coffee/morning experience, it must be great.  I need to plan a trip back to enjoy a few glasses soon.\\n\\nPress is a great addition to the local coffee/wine scene.

       "      <td>Pros: \\n- Easy to make money if you lack a college education.\\n- A tourist economy that permits upward mobility among lower classes via tips. Also, it has become standard decorum in Vegas to tip in industries in that are not perceived as tip-worthy elsewhere (e.g., nail salons, car washes).\\n- Kitschy architecture and art that is unique to Vegas. \\n- Affordable houses and townhouses. \\n- Less racial tension than other larger cities.\\n- FREE PARKING EVERYWHERE!!! Parking lots are abundant, rarely do you ever have to park on the street, and parking lots are always free. \\n- Cool place if you like to gamble and party.\\n- A truly 24 hour city - you can do your grocery shopping, hit the gym, or go out to dinner 24/7. \\n- The winters aren't warm (it's a desert, not the coast), but snow in the winter is never an issue. \\n- Never humid, with a little extra conditioner you can get your hair to do whatever the hell you want it to and never have to worry about it going flat or frizzy.\\n- Amazing shopping (think Chanel rather than Intermix). \\n- Fine dining epicenter (housed in casinos only). \\n\\nCons: \\n- The women in Vegas are vacuous, uneducated, with bad style. Frosted pink lipstick, huge fake boobs, haggard ex-druggie face, baby-T's and distressed denim, and lots of sweat. I feel like I'm in an eighties porno. \\n- Incestuous social circles. \\n- No locally grown food, and the stuff that is grown here isn't organic (or particularly nutritious since there is no decent soil in the valley). Consequently, the food off the strip is prepared with ingredients that are shipped in from California. These ingredients are picked before they are sufficiently ripened, treated with chemicals to artificially induce ripeness, and therein lies the reason why food in Vegas is tasteless and the flavors are so muted. \\n- Limited things to do if you don't drink, gamble, or go to clubs. This means that if you are under 21, you are at home getting high and playing video games (I know I was). \\n- No cultural innovation, since anyone remotely talented or creative moves somewhere else. No available jobs for creative professionals. \\n- Commuter university that doesn't lend itself to the establishment of a college town culture. \\n- One of the highest high school drop out rates in the nation.\\n- One of the least responsive media markets in the nation. You will never see a film being released here that isn't being released in at least 100 other cities. \\n- Highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation, a result of the insidious but ever-present religious power complex that exists in this city, constantly wielding its power to crush anything progressive or reasonable (like planned parenthood). \\n- Lesbian community rife w/ gnarly uneducated women in cowboy hats or catty pseudo-hipster college students. \\n- Huge population of people with limited or no education occupying high paying professions, meaning that the people operating this city are dumb as rocks. \\n- Limited mental health care facilities, which translates into having a substantial percentage of the local population self-medicated and driving drunk 24 hours a day (hence the astronomical DUI rates).\\n- One of the highest domestic abuse rates in the nation. Conjoin a bustling drug trade, the 24 hour availability of liquor, and underscore it all with a cultural milieu that hates women (ala conservative religious and androcentric sex trade gender politics), and you get sky high domestic abuse rates. \\n- The city attracts people who can't successfully live anywhere else, whether its due to their disaffecting personality, addictive behavior, or delusional relationship with reality. \\n- It's a small town masquerading as a big city. People move here because they think the valley is the Strip, when in actuality, if you're not on the Strip, you're essentially in a strip mall somewhere in Arkansas.\\n- Downtown gentrification projects and new high rise developments are elitist, the cost of which prohibit young, creative, and innovative people from affording them. \\n- All apartments have carpeted floors. Like I really want to live on a pile of fabric that has been lived on by innumerable other people that is impossible to sanitize. \\n- The men in Vegas fall into one of three categories. A) a tourist who wants to get drunk and fuck, B) local who wants to get drunk and fuck, and then go home to his unknowing wife, C) Las Vegas native with severe addiction/mommy/daddy issues.\\n- Inconvenient public trans, grid system city planning, no \\\"green\\\" spaces, recycling services that don't serve apartments.\\n- Post-segregation town; segregation was an irrefutable social scourge, but it encouraged the development of rich cultural enclaves (e.g., Little Tokyo, Little Italy, etc.). Vegas lacks these rich cultural hotspots.</td>\n",
